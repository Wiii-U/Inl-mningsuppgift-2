            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>Elden Ring is set to feature a variety of characters, both playable and non-playable. 
                However, information about the specific characters and their roles in the game is currently limited.
                The player character is an adventurer who embarks on a journey through the world of Elden Ring to uncover the mysteries of the game's story. Along the way, they will encounter a range of NPCs (non-playable characters) who will provide information, quests, and other assistance.
                It is expected that the game will feature a wide range of enemies, bosses, and other adversaries for the player to battle. 
                FromSoftware games are known for their challenging combat and intricate level design, and it's likely that 
                Elden Ring will continue this tradition.The game is co-created by Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin, it is expected that 
                the game will feature a rich and detailed story, with complex and multifaceted characters and a wide range of themes. 
                This is one of the most highly anticipated games of all time, and fans are eagerly waiting for more information 
                about the characters, story, and world of Elden Ring.
                However, it is also to be noted that Fromsoftware games are also known for their very minimalistic storytelling, 
                thus giving a lot of room for interpretation. 
                So the characters or their role might not be very clear or detailed as you expect and most of the story, 
                you need to discover it by yourself.</p>
